Here is a Python script that auto-creates or repairs a critical autonomy file named `pickup_agent.py`. This script checks if the file exists; if not, it creates it with a basic structure. If the file does exist but is missing critical components, it repairs the file by adding those missing parts. 

```python
import os

# Define the filename
filename = 'pickup_agent.py'

# Define the critical components of the script
critical_code = """import sys

class PickupAgent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def pickup_object(self, object_name):
        print(f"{self.name} is picking up {object_name}.")
        # Additional logic for picking up the object can be implemented here

def main():
    agent_name = 'DefaultAgent'
    object_to_pickup = 'default_object'

    # Check command-line arguments
    if len(sys.argv) > 2:
        agent_name = sys.argv[1]
        object_to_pickup = sys.argv[2]

    agent = PickupAgent(agent_name)
    agent.pickup_object(object_to_pickup)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
"""

# Function to check and write the critical code
def check_and_repair_script():
    if not os.path.exists(filename):
        # If file does not exist, create it with the critical components
        with open(filename, 'w') as file:
            file.write(critical_code)
        print(f"{filename} created with essential functionality.")
    else:
        # If file exists, check its content
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            file_content = file.read()

        if critical_code not in file_content:
            # If any critical part is missing, repair the script
            with open(filename, 'w') as file:
                file.write(critical_code)
            print(f"{filename} repaired with missing functionality.")
        else:
            print(f"{filename} already has the necessary functionality.")

# Run the check and repair function
check_and_repair_script()
```

### Explanation:
- The script first checks if the file named `pickup_agent.py` exists.
- If the file does not exist, it creates it with a predefined basic structure defined in `critical_code`.
- If the file exists, it checks if the critical components are part of the file. If parts are missing, it rewrites the file with the critical components.
- The critical components include:
  - A `PickupAgent` class with basic functionality.
  - A `main` function to check for command-line arguments and trigger the `PickupAgent`.
  - A script entry point using `if __name__ == "__main__"`.

This script should be placed in the same directory where you expect `pickup_agent.py` to be, or adjust accordingly if you want it to verify another directory.
