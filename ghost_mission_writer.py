Certainly! To create a standalone Python script called `ghost_mission_writer.py` for auto-creating or repairing a critical autonomy file, we'll make a few assumptions about the nature and structure of this file. Let's assume the file is a JSON structure that defines certain key missions: `mission_id`, `mission_name`, and `parameters`.

Hereâ€™s an example of how the script might be designed:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import json
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Define the default structure of the critical autonomy file
DEFAULT_MISSION_STRUCTURE = {
    "mission_id": "default_id",
    "mission_name": "default_name",
    "parameters": {
        "param1": "value1",
        "param2": "value2"
    },
    "created_at": ""
}

# Helper function to create or repair the mission file
def create_or_repair_ghost_mission(filename):
    if os.path.exists(filename):
        print(f"File '{filename}' exists. Checking integrity...")
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as file:
                content = json.load(file)
                # Check if the file structure is as expected
                if 'mission_id' in content and 'mission_name' in content and 'parameters' in content:
                    print(f"'{filename}' is complete and valid.")
                    return
                else:
                    print(f"'{filename}' is missing critical keys. Repairing the file...")
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            print(f"'{filename}' contains invalid JSON. Repairing the file...")
    else:
        print(f"File '{filename}' does not exist. Creating a new one...")

    # Create or repair the mission file
    DEFAULT_MISSION_STRUCTURE["created_at"] = datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + 'Z'  # Update timestamp
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        json.dump(DEFAULT_MISSION_STRUCTURE, file, indent=4)
    print(f"'{filename}' has been created/repaired successfully.")

def main():
    # Define the path to the ghost mission file
    filename = 'ghost_mission.json'
    create_or_repair_ghost_mission(filename)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
- **Script Purpose**: The script checks whether a `ghost_mission.json` file exists. If it does, it checks the integrity of its JSON content. If it does not exist or is corrupt (malformed JSON), it creates a new file with a default structure or repairs it.
- **Default Structure**: It contains a default mission ID, name, parameters, and a created timestamp.
- **File Handling**: Using Python's built-in `os` and `json` libraries, it checks file existence, reads the content, validates its structure, and writes the necessary repairs if needed.
- **Independence**: As a standalone script, it can be run directly via a Python interpreter and can handle errors related to file structure and content automatically.

You can expand this script with more detail about the structure and parameters based on what the mission file should precisely contain.
