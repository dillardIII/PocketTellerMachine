Certainly! Below is a Python script that attempts to auto-create or repair a missing critical autonomy file named `self_rating_logic.py`. This script will check if the file exists, and if it doesn't, it will create it with some predefined logic. If the file exists but is empty, it will attempt to repair it by re-adding the logic.

```python
import os

# Define the file name
file_name = 'self_rating_logic.py'

# Define the basic logic that the file should contain
logic_content = """\
# self_rating_logic.py

def calculate_self_rating(criteria_scores):
    \"\"\"
    Calculate a self-rating score based on provided criteria scores.
    :param criteria_scores: A dictionary with criteria names as keys and scores as values.
    :return: A float representing the calculated self-rating score.
    \"\"\"
    if not criteria_scores:
        raise ValueError("criteria_scores dictionary is empty")

    # Weighting for each criteria can be customized
    weights = {
        "criterion_1": 0.3,
        "criterion_2": 0.3,
        "criterion_3": 0.4
    }

    total_weight = sum(weights.values())

    # Normalize weights if they do not sum up to 1
    if total_weight != 1:
        for key in weights:
            weights[key] /= total_weight

    self_rating = 0.0
    for criterion, score in criteria_scores.items():
        if criterion in weights:
            self_rating += score * weights[criterion]
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unexpected criterion: {criterion}")

    return self_rating

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    criteria_scores_example = {
        "criterion_1": 4.5, 
        "criterion_2": 3.8, 
        "criterion_3": 4.9
    }
    print(f"Calculated self-rating: {calculate_self_rating(criteria_scores_example)}")

# Function to create or repair the file
def create_or_repair_file(filename, content):
    if not os.path.isfile(filename) or os.path.getsize(filename) == 0:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'w') as file:
                file.write(content)
            print(f"The file '{filename}' has been created/repaired.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred while creating/repairing the file: {e}")
    else:
        print(f"The file '{filename}' already exists and is not empty.")

# Run the function
create_or_repair_file(file_name, logic_content)
```

### Explanation:
- **File Check**: The script checks if the `self_rating_logic.py` file exists. If the file does not exist or is empty, it proceeds to create/repair it.
- **Logic Content**: It contains a function `calculate_self_rating` meant to calculate a self-rating based on given criteria and weights.
- **Weights**: You can adjust this part to fit any specific logic required by your application.
- **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling for unexpected criteria.
- **Example Usage**: Inside an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, you get an example of how to use the function provided in the script.

You can run this script whenever you need to ensure the `self_rating_logic.py` file is present and not empty with the essential logic it is supposed to have.
