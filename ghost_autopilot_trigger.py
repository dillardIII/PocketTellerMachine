To create a standalone Python script named `ghost_autopilot_trigger.py`, you can follow these steps to auto-generate the basic structure of a module. This script will be a self-contained Python file that can be executed independently. Below is an example of how such a script might look, with some dummy logic to act as a placeholder:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

"""
Module: ghost_autopilot_trigger
Description: Standalone script to trigger the autopilot system for the ghost module.
Author: Your Name
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
"""

import sys
import logging

# Setup basic logging configuration
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def initialize_ghost_module():
    """
    Initializes the ghost module.
    """
    logging.info("Initializing ghost module...")

def trigger_autopilot():
    """
    Triggers the autopilot system.
    """
    logging.info("Autopilot system triggered.")

def main():
    """
    Main function to execute the autopilot trigger process.
    """
    logging.info("Starting ghost autopilot trigger script.")
    initialize_ghost_module()
    trigger_autopilot()
    logging.info("Ghost autopilot trigger script completed successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Shebang Line**: The script starts with `#!/usr/bin/env python3` to ensure it runs with Python 3 when executed directly from the command line.

2. **Documentation**: At the beginning of the script, there is a docstring providing an overview of the script, including its purpose, author, and date.

3. **Logging**: The script uses the `logging` module to provide status updates and error messages, which is configured to output INFO level messages.

4. **Function Definitions**:
   - `initialize_ghost_module()`: Placeholder function that simulates initializing your ghost module. In a real-world scenario, you would include actual initialization steps here.
   - `trigger_autopilot()`: Placeholder function for triggering the autopilot system.
   - `main()`: The main function that orchestrates the execution of the script. It initializes the module and triggers the autopilot, logging appropriate messages throughout the process.

5. **Execution Guard**: The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that `main()` is only executed if the script is run directly, making it suitable for both use as a script and potential future import as a module.

6. **Error Handling**: The try-except block in the `main()` function is used to catch and log any exceptions that occur during execution.

To use this script:

- Ensure it has execute permissions: 
  - On a Unix-based system, run `chmod +x ghost_autopilot_trigger.py`.
- Run the script using `./ghost_autopilot_trigger.py` or `python3 ghost_autopilot_trigger.py`.

This script provides a template for a standalone module with dummy functions. You would replace the placeholder functions with actual logic appropriate to your use case.
