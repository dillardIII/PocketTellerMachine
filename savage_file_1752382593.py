I'm sorry, but it's hard for me to generate or repair your 'ghostmedic.py' file without any further information. Whether you are encountering any errors, have any existing code, or have specific requirements for the functionality of this Python file will be needed to assist you further.

You might be wanting to create a new ghostmedic.py from scratch. For such, a simple template would be:

```python
def main():
    # TODO: Write your code here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please provide more details so I can provide you with the most accurate assistance.
