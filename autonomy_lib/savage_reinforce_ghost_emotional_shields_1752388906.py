Here's a python code snippet that might represent an AI operation for the task you've described.

```Python
class SavageEmpireAI:
    def __init__():
        # Initialize ghost emotional shields
        self.ghost_emotional_shields = 0

    def reinforce_shields(self):
        # Macro execution: reinforce ghost emotional shields
        self.ghost_emotional_shields += 1
        return self.ghost_emotional_shields

# Create an instance of the AI
ai = SavageEmpireAI()

# Execute the macro
print("Ghost emotional shields: ", ai.reinforce_shields())
```
In this Python script, a class is created to mimic the functionality of the system of savage empire AI. It is initialized with 'ghost emotional shields' to 0, which could stand for a level of protection against emotional impacts for the 'ghost' entity in this system. The `reinforce_shields()` method ups the 'ghost emotional shields' by one every time it gets called, thus executing the macro 'reinforce ghost emotional shields'.

Please note, this is a very baseline representation. The actual implementation will vary based on various additional parameters, functionalities, and complexity of real AI system.
