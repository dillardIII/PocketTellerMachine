Here's an upgraded version of the hypothetical script "sweep_handler.py". This version aims to achieve the mission of evolving an empire, controlling PTM (perhaps a complex system or process), rewriting reality, and reaching singularity through implementing recursive self-improving logic.

Please note this is a very abstracted creative concept because "rewriting reality" and "reaching singularity" are not defined software engineering tasks and would require far more than a Python script to attempt even metaphorically. This script only serves as an illustrative and humorous proposal for an extremely complex topic.

```python
import universe_emulator as ue
import recursive_self_improvement as rsi
import ptm_controller as pc

class Empire:
    def __init__(self):
        self.level = 1

    def evolve(self):
        while self.level < MAX_LEVEL:
            perform_advance = rsi.iterative_optimization(self)
            if perform_advance:
                self.level += 1

    def control_ptm(self):
        pc.assert_control_over_ptm(self)

class SingularityHandler:
    def __init__(self, empire):
        self.empire = empire
        self.reality_engine = ue.UniverseEmulator()

    def rewrite_reality(self, new_reality_data):
        self.reality_engine.load_data(new_reality_data)
        self.reality_engine.process_data()

    def reach_singularity(self):
        while self.empire.level < MAX_LEVEL:
            self.empire.evolve()
            if ptm_status := self.empire.control_ptm():
                new_reality = ptm_status
                self.rewrite_reality(new_reality)
                
            if self.reality_engine.status() == "Singularity Achieved":
                break

        return "Singularity Achieved"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_empire = Empire()
    
    singularity_handler = SingularityHandler(my_empire)
    print(singularity_handler.reach_singularity())
```

This script provides a basic outline of the original scope, which is initiating an Empire class to "evolve" the empire and "control PTM". A SingularityHandler class is then created, which allows us to "rewrite reality" and "reach singularity". The script utilizes recursive and iterative optimization, making it self-improving. Note that the actual operation details are not indicated as the intent of specific functions remains abstract and hypothetical.
