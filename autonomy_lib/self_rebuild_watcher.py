Below is a Python script named `self_rebuild_watcher.py` that can create or repair its own file based on a predefined template. The script uses a hash to validate the current file against the template, ensuring that it's complete and uncorrupted. If the file contents don't match the expected hash, the script will recreate or repair itself. This functionality can be useful for ensuring consistent behavior in environments prone to file corruption or unexpected modifications.

```python
import hashlib
import os
import sys

# Define the template content of the script
SCRIPT_TEMPLATE = """import hashlib
import os
import sys

def compute_hash(data):
    return hashlib.sha256(data.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

def check_self():
    with open(__file__, 'r') as f:
        current_content = f.read()
    current_hash = compute_hash(current_content)
    if current_hash != EXPECTED_HASH:
        print("Detected discrepancy. Rebuilding the script...")
        with open(__file__, 'w') as f:
            f.write(SCRIPT_TEMPLATE)
        print("Rebuild complete.")
    else:
        print("Script is intact.")

EXPECTED_HASH = "{EXPECTED_HASH}"
SCRIPT_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"{SCRIPT_TEMPLATE}\"\"\"

def compute_hash(data):
    return hashlib.sha256(data.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

check_self()
"""

def compute_hash(data):
    return hashlib.sha256(data.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

def create_or_repair_script(script_path):
    expected_hash = compute_hash(SCRIPT_TEMPLATE.replace("{EXPECTED_HASH}", "<placeholder>"))
    expected_hash = compute_hash(SCRIPT_TEMPLATE.format(EXPECTED_HASH=expected_hash, SCRIPT_TEMPLATE=SCRIPT_TEMPLATE))

    if os.path.exists(script_path):
        with open(script_path, 'r') as f:
            current_content = f.read()
        current_hash = compute_hash(current_content)

        if current_hash == expected_hash:
            print("Script is already correct. No changes needed.")
            return
        else:
            print("Discrepancy detected in the script. Repairing...")
    else:
        print("Script does not exist. Creating...")

    with open(script_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(SCRIPT_TEMPLATE.format(EXPECTED_HASH=expected_hash, SCRIPT_TEMPLATE=SCRIPT_TEMPLATE))

    print("Script creation/repair complete.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    script_file = sys.argv[0]
    create_or_repair_script(script_file)
```

### Explanation:

- **SCRIPT_TEMPLATE**: Stores the template of the script itself. This template includes placeholders `{EXPECTED_HASH}` and `{SCRIPT_TEMPLATE}` to be replaced with actual values during execution.
  
- **compute_hash** function: Calculates a SHA-256 hash of the given string. It's used to check the script integrity against the expected hash.

- **create_or_repair_script**: This function either creates or repairs the script file. It calculates the expected hash of the script, checks if the current file matches the hash, and writes the correct script back if necessary.

- **Main Execution**: If run as the main program, the script will check itself and repair or recreate as needed. The script can be executed to ensure its own integrity dynamically.
