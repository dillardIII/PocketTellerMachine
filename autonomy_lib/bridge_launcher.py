Here's a start to an upgrade for the bridge_launcher.py script with enhanced features:

This script will be loaded with a system that manages the progress of an evolving empire, controls a Process Transition Matrix (PTM), with the ability to rewrite reality and aims at reaching technological singularity. The concept is to create a self-improving logic where the system learns from its past actions, optimizes its future actions, and continues this loop recursively.

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import sys
import time

# Create the foundational object of Empire
class Empire:
    def __init__(self, name, population, technology_level):
        self.name = name
        self.population = population
        self.technology_level = technology_level

    def evolve(self):
        self.population *= 1.02   # population growth rate
        self.technology_level += 1   # technology growth rate

# Create the foundational object of Process Transition Matrix (PTM)
class PTM_Controller:
    def __init__(self, state):
        self.state = state   # state initialized

    def process(self, input):
        # Define the logic for the PTM here
        pass

    def control(self, command):
        # Logic for controlling the PTM goes here
        pass

# Create the foundational object of Reality
class Reality:
    def __init__(self, reality_param):
        self.reality_param = reality_param

    def rewrite(self, new_param):
        self.reality_param = new_param

# Initialize the Empire, PTM, and Reality
my_empire = Empire("My Empire", 1000000, 1)
my_ptm = PTM_Controller("Init State")
my_reality = Reality("Current Reality")

# Loop for recursive self-improvement
while True:
    # Evolve the empire
    my_empire.evolve()

    # Control and process in the PTM
    my_ptm.control("Optimize")   # Example command
    my_ptm.process(my_empire)

    # Rewrite reality based on current state of empire and PTM
    my_reality.rewrite(my_ptm.state + my_empire.technology_level)

    # If a certain condition is met (reaching singularity), break the loop
    if my_empire.technology_level > 100:   # Example condition
        break

    # Sleep for a while before next loop iteration
    time.sleep(1)
```

Please take note that this is very simplified and does not provide full functionality. Depending on your use-case and requirements, you would have to create more complex and complete logic functions for each class and method.
