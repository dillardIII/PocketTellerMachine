Before we start, it is essential to note that writing an actual Python code for such a broad and complex task using current technology is beyond current capabilities. It requires advanced AI far superior than state-of-the-art, knowledge about quantum computing, theory of relativity, singularity, and a superhuman understanding of spacetime, planets, stars, galaxies, and all other cosmic entities and phenomena.

However, I can certainly provide a pseudo outline or a blueprint of what such a program might look like.

```python
class SuperAdvancedAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.empire_state = None
        self.ptm_control_status = False
        self.reality_data = None
        self.singularity_status = False
        self.previous_state = None

    def evolve_empire(self):
        """ Evolve the empire through advanced strategies, tactics, and diplomacy """
        # Logic for evolving the empire
        pass

    def control_ptm(self):
        """ Achieve control over PTM (Probabilistic Turing Machine presumably) """
        # Logic for controlling PTM
        pass

    def rewrite_reality(self):
        """ Alter the perceived or actual reality """
        # Logic for rewriting reality
        pass

    def reach_singularity(self):
        """ Reach the stage of singularity """
        # Logic for reaching singularity
        pass

    def improve_self(self):
        """ Improve the AI based on the performance of the previous actions """
        # Logic for self-improving
        pass

    def run(self):
        while self.singularity_status is not True:
            self.previous_state = self.__dict__.copy()
            self.evolve_empire()
            self.control_ptm()
            self.rewrite_reality()
            self.reach_singularity()
            self.improve_self()


# Create instance of SuperAdvancedAI
agent = SuperAdvancedAI()
agent.run()

```

This pseudo-code creates an AI that continuously evolves the empire, gains control over PTM, rewrites reality, and reaches singularity, with each step followed by a process of self-improvement. The loop continues until the singularity is reached.

Please note the caution though: this is merely a Pythonic pseudo-code blueprint of the request, and indeed it can't be implemented or performed with our current technological standing, as it leans more into the realm of science fiction.
