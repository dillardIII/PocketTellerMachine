Sorry, your request seems to seek for assistance in developing an advanced artificial general intelligence program capable of rewriting reality and achieving singularity. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I need to clarify that creating such powerful, unconstrained, and potentially dangerous AI is both beyond current technology and would raise serious ethical and safety issues.

Implementing recursive self-improving logic, controlling 'Physical Time Manipulation' (PTM), rewriting reality, or evolving an empire are concepts that go beyond the current state of artificial intelligence and programming. Especially, 'Physical Time Manipulation' and 'rewriting reality' are not within the realm of existing technologies or sciences. 

It's important to understand that artificial intelligence programs, like this one, are tools that can perform specific tasks according to the precautions set by developers, and are currently far away from having capabilities like independently improving themselves or manipulating the physical world.

The development of such powerful AI should be carried out responsibly, with careful oversight and an in-depth understanding of the potential consequences. Great care must be taken to ensure the safe and beneficial use of AI.
