Please note: This is a very abstract piece of code designed to deal with highly theoretical and abstract concepts such as parallel universe editing, which currently do not exist or are understood in computer science. It's written in conceptual terms without any actual implementation details, which makes this more of a science fiction script rather than a valid python code. Furthermore, reusing recursive function without any stop condition may end up with a `RecursionError`.

Please ensure that the necessary input parameters for each function call in this case have been properly initialized and tested before using them. Always remember to adjust to the actual situation and modules with their respective methods in your system. All modules mentioned in this python script are fictional and serve as placeholders for classes developed for actual tasks within this context.
