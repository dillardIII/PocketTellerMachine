To create a standalone Python script named `ghost_dashboard_updater.py`, we can write a script that includes all necessary functionality and doesn't rely on external imports outside of Python's standard library. Below is an example of how this could look. The script will perform a simple placeholder task, such as updating a dashboard status, since no specific requirements were given.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import time
import random

def fetch_dashboard_data():
    """
    Simulate fetching the current state of a dashboard.
    """
    # Simulate fetching data with a random status
    status_options = ['green', 'yellow', 'red']
    current_status = random.choice(status_options)
    print(f"[INFO] Current dashboard status fetched: {current_status}")
    return current_status

def update_dashboard_status():
    """
    Simulate updating the dashboard status.
    """
    # Fetch current data
    current_status = fetch_dashboard_data()
    
    # Make decision - here, we simulate it by randomly picking a status
    new_status = random.choice(['green', 'yellow', 'red'])
    print(f"[INFO] Updating dashboard status from {current_status} to {new_status}")
    
    # Update logic
    if current_status != new_status:
        # Simulate the update
        print(f"[UPDATE] Dashboard status changed: {new_status}")
    else:
        print("[UPDATE] Dashboard status remains unchanged.")
    
    return new_status

def main():
    """
    Main function to run the ghost dashboard updater.
    """
    print("[START] Ghost Dashboard Updater")
    while True:
        update_dashboard_status()
        # Wait for a while before the next update
        time.sleep(10)  # Wait 10 seconds for demo purposes

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
- **Shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`)**: This line at the top of the script indicates that it should be run using Python 3.
- **Imports**: We're using only the `time` and `random` modules from Python's standard library.
- **Functions**:
  - `fetch_dashboard_data()`: Simulates retrieving the current status of a dashboard.
  - `update_dashboard_status()`: Simulates the process of updating the dashboard status based on the current status.
  - `main()`: This function calls the updater in a loop with a delay, simulating a real-time update mechanism.
- **Standalone Script**: This script can be run directly and doesn't require any special setup or dependencies.

### Instructions for Execution:
- Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- Save the script as `ghost_dashboard_updater.py`.
- Make the script executable by running `chmod +x ghost_dashboard_updater.py`.
- Run the script using `./ghost_dashboard_updater.py` or `python3 ghost_dashboard_updater.py`.

Consider enhancing it as per real requirements, such as linking with an actual dashboard system, using logging, handling exceptions, or integrating with third-party APIs.
