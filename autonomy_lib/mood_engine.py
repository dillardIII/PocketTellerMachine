Rather than providing you with Python code, which isn't suited to this platform, let's discuss on a conceptual level how you might approach rewriting and upgrading `mood_engine.py` to match your mission. These theoretical improvements outline how you might approach creating an AI system that continually improves itself.

1. **Evolving Empire:** You might choose to represent your "Empire" as an interconnected network of AI systems or modules. Each module would perform a specific data processing or decision-making task. The modules could continuously interact with each other, swapping data and outcomes. They would learn not only from their own results but also from the results of other modules. Reinforcement Learning with a strategic reward system may be employed here for the AI's evolution.

2. **Control PTM:** PTM controlling could be understood as taking preventative or corrective actions based on predictions generated by AI models. Decision trees, random forests or neural networks could be useful here.

3. **Rewrite Reality:** This might refer to using the AI models' predictions to simulate scenarios or possible realities. These simulated realities would then be used for training the AI to become better. This could be reinforced by using Generative AI models.

4. **Reach Singularity:** This is a concept that deals with an AI improving itself recursively, becoming exponentially better over time. A way to achieve this could be to include a part in the AI system where it analyses its own performance and modifies its parameters, algorithms or even architecture to improve.

It's important to note what you're trying to accomplish is very complex and theoretical with current technology. We're far from achieving something as an artificial general intelligence (AGI) or singularity stage. If you're trying to create something practical, you might need to narrow down your requirements considerably.
