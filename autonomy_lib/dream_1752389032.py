Below a Python module for an Autonomy function: This module is named as "EmpireGhostAI". This module works on defining the basic infrastructure of a Ghost Empire: Troops, Structures, Economy, and Diplomacy. And each of these is treated as an autonomous system which further is structured using classes and methods to achieve various tasks. 

However, the Python file included here only contains some basic functionalities of an autonomous AI system for your ghost empire game module. Make sure to extend the classes and methods to suit your game requirements.

```python
# EmpireGhostAI.py

import random

class Troop:
    def __init__(self, amount):
        self.amount = amount

    def reinforce(self, extra_troops):
        self.amount += extra_troops
        return self.amount

class Structure:
    def __init__(self, level):
        self.level = level

    def upgrade(self):
        self.level += 1
        return self.level

class Economy:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def earn(self, income):
        self.balance += income
        return self.balance

    def spend(self, expense):
        self.balance -= expense
        return self.balance

class Diplomacy:
    def __init__(self, allies, enemies):
        self.allies = allies
        self.enemies = enemies

    def add_ally(self, ally_name):
        self.allies.append(ally_name)

    def add_enemy(self, enemy_name):
        self.enemies.append(enemy_name)


class GhostEmpire:
    def __init__(self, troops, structures, economy, diplomacy):
        self.troops = Troop(troops)
        self.structures = Structure(structures)
        self.economy = Economy(economy)
        self.diplomacy = Diplomacy(diplomacy)

    def autonomy(self):
        action = random.randint(1, 4)

        if action == 1:  # Upgrade
            self.structures.upgrade()
            self.economy.spend(1000)
        elif action == 2:  # Reinforce Troops
            self.troops.reinforce(500)
            self.economy.spend(1000)
        elif action == 3:  # Earn
            self.economy.earn(random.randint(1000, 5000))
        elif action == 4:  # Diplomacy
            self.diplomacy.add_ally("Ally_" + str(random.randint(1, 100)))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    autonomous_empire = GhostEmpire(2000, 5, 10000, ['ally1', 'ally2'], ['enemy1'])
    for i in range(10):  # Every empire will perform 10 autonomous actions
        autonomous_empire.autonomy()
```

Remember that AI's capabilities are hand-coded and do not have any machine learning techniques to learn from the environment. You can, however, implement reinforcement learning algorithm if you want the AI to "learn" from their actions.
