Without specific details regarding what exactly needs to be repaired or generated in the code file for the "patch vault system", it's difficult to provide accurate code. However, here is an example of a possible patch for a simple vault system written in Python.

Let's assume you have a basic Vault system with the following hypothetical issues:
1. The password authentication doesn't work correctly.
2. The data is not encrypted.

```python
import os
import base64
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding

class Vault:

    def __init__(self, password):
        salt = os.urandom(16)
        self.kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
            algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
            length=32,
            salt=salt,
            iterations=100000,
        )
        key = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(self.kdf.derive(password))
        self.fernet = Fernet(key)
        
        self.data = {}

    def add_to_vault(self, key, value):
        self.data[key] = self.encrypt_data(value)

    def encrypt_data(self, data):
        return self.fernet.encrypt(data.encode())

    def decrypt_data(self, data):
        return self.fernet.decrypt(data).decode()

    def get_from_vault(self, key):
        if key in self.data:
            return self.decrypt_data(self.data[key])
        else:
            return None
```

You should replace `password` in the `__init__` function with your own secure password to encrypt the data stored within the vault.

This Vault system now has a secure PBKDF2HMAC-based password hashing mechanism and uses Fernet symmetric encryption for data stored in the vault.
