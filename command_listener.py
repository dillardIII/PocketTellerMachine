Certainly! Below is a Python script named `command_listener.py` that serves as a template for a command listener. This script provides basic functionality to listen for commands, log the entries, and handle exceptions in case any part of the process fails. This script is designed to be standalone and includes essential elements like logging and command processing placeholders which can be further extended based on specific requirements.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import sys
import logging
import time

# Setting up a basic logger
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
logger = logging.getLogger('CommandListener')

def setup_logging():
    """Sets up the logging configuration."""
    log_filename = 'command_listener.log'
    file_handler = logging.FileHandler(log_filename)
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(file_handler)

def check_environment():
    """Checks if necessary environment setup is done."""
    # Example check - Ensure this script is running on a supported OS
    supported_os = ["Linux", "Darwin", "Windows"]
    if sys.platform not in supported_os:
        logger.warning(f"Unsupported OS: {sys.platform}. Supported OS: {supported_os}")

def listen_for_commands():
    """A dummy function to mimic listening for commands."""
    logger.info("Listening for commands. Press Ctrl+C to stop.")
    while True:
        try:
            # Placeholder: Simulate a command being received
            simulated_command = "example_command"
            process_command(simulated_command)
            time.sleep(5)  # Simulating time delay between receiving commands
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            logger.info("Stopping command listener.")
            break
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"An error occurred while listening for commands: {e}")

def process_command(command):
    """Processes the received command."""
    logger.info(f"Processing command: {command}")
    # Placeholder for command execution logic
    # You can expand the logic to handle different commands here
    try:
        # Simulate command handling
        logger.info(f"Command '{command}' processed successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to process command '{command}': {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    setup_logging()
    check_environment()
    listen_for_commands()
```

### Explanation:

- **Logging**: A logger is set up to track the execution flow and errors. Log entries are saved to `command_listener.log`.
- **Environment Check**: The script performs a simple environment check to verify itâ€™s running on a supported OS. This can be extended to include more checks if needed.
- **Command Listening**: The `listen_for_commands` function simulates listening for incoming commands in an infinite loop, with an example command `example_command`.
- **Command Processing**: The `process_command` function demonstrates how a command might be processed. This is a placeholder to be replaced with actual command handling logic.

This script serves as a foundational starting point and should be extended with more specific details to meet particular needs, such as integrating real command sources and actions.
