Sure, but I will need a bit more details about what the 'savage swarm agent' does to generate its code file. For now, I can make a basic structure of a Python class representing an agent:

```python
class SavageSwarmAgent:

    def __init__(self):
        # Initiate the agent
        pass

    def get_action(self, state):
        # This function should return the next action the agent should take based on the given state
        pass

    def update(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        # This function should update the agent state based on the taken action and received reward
        pass

    def train(self):
        # In this function you can put the agent training code
        pass

```

Please provide more details or requirements for this agent, so I can update the code accordingly.
