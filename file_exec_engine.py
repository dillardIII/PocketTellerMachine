Creating a standalone Python script, `file_exec_engine.py`, involves defining a script that can be executed on its own. The script will be designed to auto-create or repair itself if missing or corrupted. Here's a simple version of such a script. The script will check its integrity by comparing its content with a predefined checksum or backup content. If the file is missing or corrupted, it will recreate itself with the correct content.

```python
import os
import hashlib

# Define the expected content of the script
EXPECTED_CONTENT = """\"\"\"
This is a standalone script: file_exec_engine.py
Auto-creates or repairs itself if missing or corrupted.
\"\"\"

def main():
    print("Executing important tasks...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
"""

# Compute the expected checksum of the script content
EXPECTED_CHECKSUM = hashlib.sha256(EXPECTED_CONTENT.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

def verify_file_integrity(file_path):
    """Verify the integrity of the existing file by comparing its checksum."""
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        return False

    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        actual_content = f.read()
    actual_checksum = hashlib.sha256(actual_content.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

    return actual_checksum == EXPECTED_CHECKSUM

def create_or_repair_file(file_path):
    """Create or repair the file to ensure it matches the expected content."""
    if not verify_file_integrity(file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(EXPECTED_CONTENT)
        print(f"File '{file_path}' has been created or repaired.")
    else:
        print(f"File '{file_path}' is intact and does not need repair.")

def main():
    # Define the file path
    file_path = 'file_exec_engine.py'
    
    # Create or repair the file
    create_or_repair_file(file_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### How It Works:
1. **EXPECTED_CONTENT**: The script content is stored as a string variable.
2. **EXPECTED_CHECKSUM**: Compute a checksum of the expected content using SHA-256.
3. **verify_file_integrity**: This function checks if the file exists and if its content matches the expected checksum.
4. **create_or_repair_file**: If the file is missing or corrupted, it writes the correct content to the file.
5. **main**: The main function checks and repairs the file by calling `create_or_repair_file`.

### Running the Script:
- Save the above code in a file named `file_exec_engine.py`.
- Execute it using a Python interpreter. If the script itself is missing or corrupted, it will repair or recreate the file with the correct content. If it is intact, it will confirm that no repairs are needed.
