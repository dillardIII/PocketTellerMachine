To create a standalone Python script named `whisper_autolistener.py`, you'll want to include essential components such as error handling, file checking, and basic functionality relevant to its name. Below is an example script that sets a foundation for such a file. It does not include specific `whisper`-related functionality, as the context for "whisper" is unclear (it could refer to OpenAI's Whisper speech-to-text model, or something else), but it does cover the structure and basic file operations:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import sys

def check_and_repair_file(filepath):
    """
    Ensure that the file at `filepath` exists. If it doesn't exist, create it
    with a basic structure pertinent to a 'whisper_autolistener'.
    """
    if not os.path.exists(filepath):
        create_new_file(filepath)

def create_new_file(filepath):
    """
    Create a new file with a basic structure to start the whisper_autolistener.
    """
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'w') as file:
            file.write("#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\n")
            file.write("\"\"\"\n")
            file.write("whisper_autolistener.py - A script to initiate and manage whisper\n")
            file.write("autonomy tasks.\n\n")
            file.write("Ensure integration with features like audio recording,\n")
            file.write("speech recognition, and automated responses.\n")
            file.write("\"\"\"\n\n")
            file.write("import sys\n\n")
            file.write("def main():\n")
            file.write("    print('Initializing Whisper Auto Listener...')\n")
            file.write("    # Implement core functionality here\n")
            file.write("\n")
            file.write("if __name__ == '__main__':\n")
            file.write("    main()\n")
        
        print(f"Created new file: {filepath}")
    except IOError as e:
        print(f"Failed to create file {filepath}: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

def main():
    """
    The main function that runs the script execution logic.
    """
    # Set the path to whisper_autolistener.py
    script_name = "whisper_autolistener.py"
    script_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), script_name)

    # Check if the file exists and repair or create as necessary
    check_and_repair_file(script_path)

    # You can add more logic here if needed to check contents or validate structure
    print(f"File {script_name} is present and ready.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Features of this Script:

1. **File Checking and Creation:**
   - The script checks if `whisper_autolistener.py` exists.
   - If not, it creates the file with a simple template.

2. **Basic Structure:**
   - The template includes a basic header and a `main` function where whisper-related logic can be implemented.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Basic handling of file creation errors is included.

4. **Standalone Execution:**
   - The script is standalone and can be executed directly to ensure/repair the presence of `whisper_autolistener.py`.

You'd customize this script according to your specific needs and what the "whisper" or "auto listener" should specifically perform in your context.
