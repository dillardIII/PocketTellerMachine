As an AI model, I am unable to directly access files or know current state of 'savage_macro_dashboard.py'. However, I can guide you or give you an example on how to optimize your python files, this might help you to revise and optimize your existing Python script.

Here's an example of how a Python file could be optimized:

1. If there are unnecessary imports, you can remove them. Unused libraries slow down the program's speed and takes up additional memory.
2. Use built-in functions and libraries if possible instead of writing your own algorithms.
3. Use local variables as much as possible. Accessing local variables is faster than global variables in Python.
4. Recursive functions tend to be slow and consume more memory. If possible, use iterative solutions.

```python
import pandas as pd

def calculate_metric(df):
    return df['column1'].sum()/df['column2'].sum()

def optimize_dashboard(dashboard_file):
    # load your dashboard data
    df = pd.read_csv(dashboard_file)

    # Perform your operations
    metric_result = calculate_metric(df)

    # Save your outputs or update your dashboard
    df['new_metric'] = metric_result
    df.to_csv('optimized_dashboard.csv', index=False)

dashboard_file = 'savage_macro_dashboard.csv'
optimize_dashboard(dashboard_file)
```
You can take above example and mapping it to your 'savage_macro_dashboard.py' file. It is crucial to understand that for further optimization, we need more information about the file operations, and logic. This above solution is a very basic optimization case. You need to take into account the time/space complexity of your program to dive deeper. 

Please provide the specific codes or functions that you want to optimize, so I can give you more accurate suggestions.
