Creating a standalone Python script to auto-create or repair a file named `ghost_emotion_engine.py` involves implementing functionality to check if the file exists, and if it doesn't, create it with a basic template or repaired content. Below is a sample script that accomplishes this task:

```python
import os

# Define the file name
file_name = 'ghost_emotion_engine.py'

# Define the content template for creating or repairing the file
template_content = """
# ghost_emotion_engine.py
# Autonomously generate or repair critical emotion engine functionality for ghosts

class GhostEmotionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.emotions = {
            'happy': 0,
            'sad': 0,
            'angry': 0,
            'scared': 0
        }

    def set_emotion(self, emotion, value):
        if emotion in self.emotions:
            self.emotions[emotion] = value
        else:
            print(f"Emotion '{emotion}' not recognized.")

    def get_emotion(self, emotion):
        return self.emotions.get(emotion, None)

    def process_emotions(self):
        # Example processing logic to adjust emotions
        for emotion in self.emotions:
            self.emotions[emotion] *= 0.9  # Decay effect

    def display_emotions(self):
        print("Current Emotions State:")
        for emotion, value in self.emotions.items():
            print(f"{emotion}: {value}")

# Example usage of the GhostEmotionEngine class
if __name__ == "__main__":
    engine = GhostEmotionEngine()
    engine.set_emotion('happy', 100)
    engine.process_emotions()
    engine.display_emotions()
"""

# Function to check and create or repair the file
def check_and_create_or_repair_file(file_name, content):
    # Check if the file exists
    if not os.path.exists(file_name):
        with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
            file.write(content)
        print(f"'{file_name}' was not found and has been created.")
    else:
        print(f"'{file_name}' already exists. No action is needed.")

# Execute the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_and_create_or_repair_file(file_name, template_content)
```

### Explanation:

- **File Check and Creation**: The script checks if `ghost_emotion_engine.py` exists.
  - If it does not exist, the script creates it using the provided template content.
  - If it exists, we simply acknowledge its presence.

- **Basic Template**: The template provides essential functionality for a hypothetical `GhostEmotionEngine`, including methods for setting, getting, and processing ghost emotions.

- **Standalone Script**: The script is standalone and can be run without any dependencies outside the standard library. Running this script will create or verify the presence of the `ghost_emotion_engine.py` file.

This script should fit into a variety of contexts where automated file creation or basic repair functionality is necessary. You can replace or expand the `template_content` with more specific functionality required by your implementation needs.
